# Subjective-Answer-Evaluator

*This project presents a subjective answer evaluation system designed to assess the quality and correctness of subjective answers provided by individuals. The system employs a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and evaluate the content, coherence, and relevance of the answers. The system's performance is evaluated using a set of parameters such as grammar factor, spell-check, keyword accuracy and similarity factor.*
